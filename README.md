# Car-Rental-Nihal
This is my project on renting car using JFrame, ActionListener which means an interface application on renting car in simple steps.
This application helps a user to rent car by entering the details and if all are valid then, another frame pop-up where the person can choose the car from available models and number of days he wants to rent the car, so that total amount the user has to pay for renting can be calculated and saved in a file for further queries.
